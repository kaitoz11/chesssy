// Piece-square tables say what a piece is worth on a given square: a knight on the
// rim is worth less than one in the centre, a pawn on the seventh rank far more than
// one on the second. Each piece has two tables, one for the middlegame and one for
// the endgame, and eval.go blends between them.
//
// The literals below are written from white's point of view with rank 8 first, so
// they read like a board. computePieceSquareTables reindexes them to A1 = 0 and
// mirrors them for black, folding in the material value so that a single lookup
// yields both.

// Material values in centipawns, middlegame and endgame. A pawn is worth about 100,
